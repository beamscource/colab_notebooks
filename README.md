# Applied Science Curriculum
A collection of my personal summary notes of different books and courses I've completed to fullfil a basic applied science curriculum with a focus on deep learning and NLP.

The list of topics covered/planned:

Part I:
- Mathematical concepts used for Machine Learning 
- Machine Learning Concepts
- Deep Learning Architectures (MLP, CNN, RNN/LSTM, Transformer)
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Leetcode questions and solutions

Part IIa:
- deep learning libraries (PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning) 
- model development (training, experiment logging, EDA, data drift, etc)
- Hugging Face with PyTorch
- PyTorch on AWS SageMaker

Part IIb:
- applications in the field of language technology (Neural NLU, QA, TTS)
- Machine Learning Systems Design and MLOps
